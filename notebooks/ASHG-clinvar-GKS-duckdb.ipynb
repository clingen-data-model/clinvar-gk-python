It also has the benefit of being able to query GZIP-compressed NDJSON files directly, so disk storage stays minimal, and presenting a SQL interface to the data, with full support of nested structs so we can access fields from nested JSON objects without manipulating the files. Another benefit is that it gracefully handles heterogeneous record schemas, automatically nulling values that don't exist in particular rows."
